# propsimpy
Python resurrection of Theodor Schmidt's PropSim propeller analysis program.

**DO NOT TRUST THIS CODE**

This is (at least initially) a fairly literal translation to python of the BASIC source code listing in [1]. 

It has been compared to the printed output examples in [1] and [2]. It does not match exactly, but the correspondence seems useably close.
